    <p>This site is meant to be a funny adaptation for a college success type site. It is told by the character Uncle Poopy for those that
        are attending college for the first time or long time attenders. It is filled with resources for many people who find themselves away from
        what they call home for the first years of their adult life. Everything Uncle Poopy wished he had knew before he did it. The way the site
        works is by selecting a category from the drop down menu and creating a "jeopordy game" by clicking the link and clicking around looking for
        information. All information is stored in an easy to get to format on the index page as well. Color scheme will be blue on blue. Font will be
        something like Arial/sans Serif</p>
